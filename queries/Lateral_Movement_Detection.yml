  This query uses CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL) to detect lateral movement activities:

  1. **Network Connections**: `#event_simpleName=NetworkConnect`
     - Monitors outbound network connections from endpoints

  2. **Target Ports**: `(RemotePort=445 OR RemotePort=3389 OR RemotePort=5985)`
     - Focuses on SMB (445), RDP (3389), and WinRM (5985) connections

  3. **External Targets**: `!cidr(RemoteAddressIP4, subnet=["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"])`
     - Excludes internal network ranges to focus on external connections

  4. **Process Context**: `join({#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2}, field=[aid, RawProcessId], include=[ImageFileName, CommandLine])`
     - Adds process information for the connecting application

  5. **User Context**: `join({#event_simpleName=UserIdentity}, field=AuthenticationID, include=[UserName])`
     - Enriches with user account information

  6. **Output**: `table([aid, UserName, ImageFileName, RemoteAddressIP4, RemotePort, CommandLine])`
     - Shows user, process, target IP, and connection details
