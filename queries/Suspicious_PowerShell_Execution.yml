explanation: |
  This query looks for PowerShell executions that include encoded commands, which are often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. It also checks for unusual parent processes that may indicate suspicious activity. The results will show the authentication ID, username, parent process name, PowerShell executable name, and the command line used.
