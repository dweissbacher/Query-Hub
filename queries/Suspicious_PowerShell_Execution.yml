  This query uses CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL) to detect suspicious PowerShell activity:

  1. **Event Filtering**: `#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 ImageFileName=/\\powershell\\.exe/i`
     - Searches ProcessRollup2 events for any PowerShell executable (case-insensitive)

  2. **Command Line Analysis**: `CommandLine=/\s-[eE^]{1,2}[nN][cC][oO][dD][eE][mM][aA][nN][dD^]+\s/i`
     - Uses regex to find encoded command parameters (-EncodedCommand, -enc, etc.)

  3. **User Context**: `join({#event_simpleName=UserIdentity}, field=AuthenticationID, include=[UserName])`
     - Enriches results with username information

  4. **Output**: `table([aid, UserName, ParentImageFileName, ImageFileName, CommandLine])`
     - Displays key fields for analysis
